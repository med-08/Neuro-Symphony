# Neuro-Symphony
Experience personalized music generated from your brainwaves!

Neuro-Symphony is an innovative system designed to transform neural signals into personalized, immersive musical experiences. By interpreting brainwaves and emotional states, this AI-driven technology generates unique musical compositions tailored to an individualâ€™s current mood and thoughts. The primary objective of Neuro-Symphony is to enhance mental well-being, creativity, and overall quality of life through the therapeutic power of music.

The project brings an innovative approach to how we interact with machines by using music. This concept aligns with advanced human-machine interfaces that respond to human emotions and cognitive states, a key aspect of future integration scenarios.
